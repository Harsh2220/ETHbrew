# ETHbrew
Presently, not all users have a unique ENS to interact with on-chain decentralized applications, which can create challenges in building trust and accountability. However, ETHbrew offers a solution by enabling users to create an on-chain profile that requires only a few personal details. Behind the scenes, the ETHbrew smart contract generates a unique on-chain domain for each user, where all data, including transaction logs and personalized messages, is securely stored on IPFS. Users can easily track their received MATIC transactions through the dashboard's transaction log feature. With ETHbrew, users can interact with fellow inspiration in a secure and transparent manner, while maintaining their privacy and data security.
